### Concept:
(2D Game)
It's a spring/easter themed game, you play as a easter bunny. The main object of the game is to collect as many eggs as possible.
The Player can move left and right with the AD and horizontal arrow keys. 
In the game you have only a certain amount of time. If an egg hits the floor it breaks and you lose one point.
When the time is gone your score will show up in the EndScreen.
